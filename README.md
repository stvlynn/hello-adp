## Internationalization (i18n)

Hello ADP supports multiple languages through a well-structured internationalization system. To help contributors with the i18n process:

- **Cursor Rules Integration**: When using Cursor IDE, you can quickly access i18n guidelines by using `cursor rules:@i18n.mdc`
- **Streamlined Workflow**: This rule provides templates for translation and automates the meta.json configuration
- **File Naming Conventions**: Follow the pattern `filename.{lang}.mdx` for content files (e.g., `index.mdx`, `index.zh.mdx`)
- **Translation Status**: English content is considered the source of truth, with Chinese translations maintained in parallel

The i18n rule helps ensure consistent structure across all language versions while maintaining the unique linguistic nuances of each translation.
