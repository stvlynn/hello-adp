## ðŸ¤” Why ADP Uses a Unified Workflow Design

Unlike traditional agent platforms, the Tencent Cloud Agent Development Platform (ADP) relies on a single workflow modelâ€”no need to distinguish between chat flows and workflow builders. This unified approach simplifies implementation so you can focus on real business logic.

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Advantages

**Unified workflow architecture**
- Conversation handling and business processing run inside the same workflow
- A built-in global agent node watches the conversation and orchestrates state
- Supports flexible multi-turn dialogs while ensuring precise flow execution

**Intelligent conversation management**
- Every workflow-related message is routed through the same agent
- The agent jumps to the right node based on user intent and context
- Exit and chit-chat intents are understood globally for natural UX

### ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights

**Flexible dialog orchestration**
- Multi-turn conversations with automatic completeness analysis
- Smart clarifying prompts guide users to deliver required details
- Conditional routing between nodes without pre-baked dialog trees

**Powerful node system**
- **Information collection**: parameter extraction, selector cards, and more
- **Information processing**: large-model calls, code blocks, and tool invocations
- **Foundational nodes**: start, end, branching, and other flow controls

### ðŸŒŸ Use Cases

ADP workflows shine in complex business scenarios:

**Invoice issuance**
- Collect tax information such as company name and identification numbers
- Normalize inputs with a large language model
- Call external services to validate and generate invoices

**Case processing**
- Gather key facts from customers or field agents
- Branch logic based on conditions and status tracking
- Save the final resolution into downstream systems

**Patient information queries**
- Combine identity data with case records for retrieval
- Summarize case files automatically
- Provide intelligent Q&A grounded in medical history
